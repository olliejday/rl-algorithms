#TODO:

* See below *s
* See TODOs, eg. comment code
* Update READMEs - implementation details, save theory for blog.
* Test new file structure works - need a lot of tests eg. plot_experiment etc.
* Factor out snake-gym or make it possible to run without it and link where to install it if they want to.
* Add sources
* Add links to blog (and links from blog to here)
* Make a separate branch or folder for experiments - have the algorithm code in one place and the runs in another.
* delete this todo.txt!!

PG

* Could be a bit cleaner with model.predict instead of sess.run() for rollouts?
* LOTS OF UNTESTED CHANGES - DO SOME DEBUG TESTS
* Run and report as per hw2 (ie. at least those env's and any key notes from that report)
* Add a run on some toy env

DQN

* Factor running model code out of DQN class?
* Compare forms of loss eg. one_hot multiply or gather
* Run and report as per hw3 (ie. at least those env's and any key notes from that report)
* Why does performance peak then degrade on lander? Try different learning rate schedule
* Why does Lambda cast layer only work with variable and not class variable? To do with custom objects
