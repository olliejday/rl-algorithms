* Factor out snake gym into a branch (make sure readmes etc up to date with main branch), link to and from snake repo
* Add links to blog (and links from blog to here)
* Perhaps could add actor critic from hw3
* delete this todo.txt!!

VPG

* Train lander on google colab - perhaps increase learning rate (eg. 0.01) - see hw2 params

* Do pong run on google colab
