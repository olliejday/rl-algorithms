# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Source

Algorithms included:

* Vanilla Policy Gradients (VPG) / REINFORCE
    * Advantage normalisation to reduce variance and reward to go usually help training
    * Larger batch sizes can work better
    * Sensitive to learning rate
    * Using a Neural Network baseline can reduce variance and improve training
* Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
    * Also included Double DQN variant
