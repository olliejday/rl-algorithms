#TODO:

* See below *s
* Add sources
* Make a separate branch or folder for experiments - have the algorithm code in one place and the runs in another.
* delete this todo.txt!!

PG

* Could be a bit cleaner with model.predict instead of sess.run() for rollouts?
* LOTS OF UNTESTED CHANGES - DO SOME DEBUG TESTS
* Add a run on some toy env

DQN

* Factor running code out of DQN class?
* Compare forms of loss eg. one_hot multiply or gather
* Why does performance peak then degrade on lander? Try different learning rate schedule
* Why does Lambda cast layer only work with variable and not class variable? To do with custom objects
