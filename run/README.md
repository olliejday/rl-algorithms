# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Experiments

## Introduction

Here is example code to run the algorithms on OpenAI Gym environments. Also
includes experiments on environments to show performance.

## Usage

Run with

```
cd rl-algorithms
python3 run.algorithm.main
```

Where `algorithm` is the algorithm you with to run, eg. for `dqn` it would be `python3 -m run.dqn.main`.
