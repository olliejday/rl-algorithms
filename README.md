# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## Introduction

A set of implementations of key reinforcement learning algorithms in Tensorflow. Comes with 
example experiments and code to run on OpenAI Gym environments.

See src/README.md for implementation details. 

See run/README.md for details of how to run and some example experiments.
